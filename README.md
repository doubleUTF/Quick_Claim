Quick Claim extension for Google Chrome
==============================
Filing electronic medical claims on sites such as Office Ally or MD-Online
requires tedious and repetitive data entry. Quick Claim is a
Chrome extension meant to save time by remembering
your settings and automatically filling out the dense
portion of the form (Field 24 of CMS 1500). Quick Claim is
ideal when entering same, repeating data. In most cases, the only data
that changes are dates of service and diagnoses.

UNDER DEVELOPMENT, DOESN'T WORK YET!!!
